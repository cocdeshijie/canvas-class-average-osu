# Canvas Class Average 
Chrome extension for computing the class average in Canvas using the published score details of graded assignments.

### Note: Only works for UBC classes! (for now)
To use, simply [install the extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/canvas-class-average/nddjlihpgdoojhdencidjolehihmflgm) and navigate to the Grades tab under a course page in Canvas.

### How It Works
The extension triggers the "Show All Details" button and quickly scans the score details of all graded assignments. We fetch the supplementary 5-year average from [UBCGrades](https://ubcgrades.com/) (shoutout [DonneyF](https://github.com/DonneyF)).
